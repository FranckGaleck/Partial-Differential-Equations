# Learning PDEs from Data – SINDy Project (MLDM 2023)

This repository contains the final project of Team 1 from the Machine Learning and Data Mining (MLDM) master's program at Université Jean Monnet. The project was presented during the Graduate School Manutech-SLEIGHT #11 and was awarded "Best Pitch".

## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of discovering governing partial differential equations (PDEs) from a set of unregistered electron microscopy images. The images represent physical patterns generated by self-organizing surfaces, resembling the behavior of the 2D Swift-Hohenberg equation.

The project is divided into two main components:

### 1. Image Registration

To ensure meaningful comparison and PDE inference, image alignment was performed using:

- Change Maps
- Deformation Fields
- Optimal Transport
- Phase Correlation

### 2. PDE Identification

Following alignment, two algorithms were used to identify candidate PDEs:

- SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics)
- SINDyCP (SINDy with Coordinate Perturbations)

These methods aim to infer interpretable equations that describe the underlying physical processes.
Results
The discovered PDEs show similarity to the known Swift-Hohenberg equation

Proper registration was essential to meaningful inference

Results and final equations are available in results_pde/

## Requirements

The project uses the following Python packages:

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- opencv-python
- imageio
- pyemd
- tqdm

## Results

- The discovered PDEs show structural similarity with the Swift-Hohenberg equation.
- Proper registration was essential for meaningful inference.
- Final equations and analysis are available in the `results_pde/` directory.
